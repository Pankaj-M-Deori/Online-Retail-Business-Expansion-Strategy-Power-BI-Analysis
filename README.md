# Online-Retail-Business-Expansion-Strategy (Executive Report)
## Overview
This Power BI project presents a comprehensive data analysis for an online retail business aimed at supporting executive-level decision-making, particularly around global expansion strategy, revenue trends, and customer segmentation.

Commissioned by executive stakeholders (CEO & CMO), this analysis provides actionable insights to:

- Identify seasonal sales trends.

- Explore top-performing countries and customers.

- Visualize regional demand to guide market expansion.

## Project Objective
The CEO and CMO of the online retail company sought data-driven clarity on how revenue is generated and what factors influence performance. This report supports strategic expansion decisions by answering key business questions using advanced data modeling and interactive visuals in Power BI.

## Business Questions Answered
- Monthly Revenue Trend (2011) to identify seasonality and inform forecasting for future sales cycles.

- Top 10 Countries by Revenue and Quantity Sold (Excluding UK) to find international markets with high potential.

- Top 10 Customers by Revenue to identify high revenue generating customers and initiate retention strategy.

- Regional Demand Analysis (Excluding UK) to identify markets for future expansion.

## Key Insights
- Line Chart: The revenue was fairly constant for the first 8 months (Jan-Aug), the revenue spiked from the month of September to November, with November showing the highest sales, 
  indicating strong seasonal influence (Note: Unfortunately, the data for December is incomplete, so nothing can be conclude for the month).
- Bar Chart: Countries such as Netherland, Ireland, Germany, France and Australia shows high revenue and units bought, making them ideal targets for market expansion.
- Column Chart: The Top 10 customers contribute significant but evenly distributed revenue, which shows that business does not rely solely on few customers to generate revenue. This 
  shows that the bargaining power of the customers is low and the business is in a good position.
- Map Visual: Sales are concentrated in Europe and parts of Australia, with very few in American regions. Also, Africa and Asia have no demand for our products. A new strategy targeting 
  these areas has the potential to boost sales revenues and profitability.

## Recommendations
- Focus marketing and inventory efforts from September to November, where sales historically surge. Plan major promotions and product launches around this window.
- Target Netherlands, Ireland, Germany, France and Australia for expansion. These markets already show strong demand and can deliver faster ROI with localized marketing and logistics 
  improvements.
- Since revenue is well distributed among top customers, consider offering rewards or loyalty programs that make them feel valued, to increase repeat purchases and build long-term 
  relationships.
- Current sales are concentrated in Europe and Australia. Develop small test campaigns in regions like American regions, Asia and Africa, to explore new customer segments.
